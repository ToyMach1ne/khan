The files in this folder include a child theme and the parent theme, the Runway framework. They must be used together if you choose to install this child theme. Using this combination to work in the Runway framework allows much more advanced development options including editing of the admin options and much more. It can be useful for a developer building a theme for a client wanting to customize the administrative interface or theme options.
